# Power State (WPF)
**Last Updated:** 07 March 2014

This is the code repository for a WPF app called "Power State".<br/>
It's purpose is a one-stop app for controlling Windows power states::
- Screen Off
- Screen Lock
- Sign Out
- Suspend
- Restart
- Shut Down

This app uses my own Window template which includes:
- Dark/White Theme
- Color Schemes
- Always On-Top option.
- In-place Collapse/Expand

**NOTE:** I still use this app to this day.
